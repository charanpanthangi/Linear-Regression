### Explanation of Linear Regression Formula

In Multiple Linear Regression, the formula is:

\[ y = b_0 + b_1x_1 + b_2x_2 + \ldots + b_nx_n \]

Where:
- \( y \) is the dependent variable (what we want to predict).
- \( b_0 \) is the intercept (constant term).
- \( b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n \) are the coefficients of the independent variables.
- \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \) are the independent variables (features).

**Concept**:
- **Intercept (\( b_0 \))**: The value of \( y \) when all \( x_i \) are 0.
- **Coefficients (\( b_i \))**: Represent the change in \( y \) for a one-unit change in the corresponding \( x_i \). They indicate the strength and direction of the relationship between each feature and the target.

### Python Code to Implement Multi-Linear Regression

Hereâ€™s a Python implementation of Multi-Linear Regression using the formula-based approach:



### Explanation of the Code

1. **Loading Dataset**: Load your dataset and define the independent features \( X \) and the dependent variable \( y \).

2. **Add Intercept Term**: Append a column of ones to \( X \) to include the intercept \( b_0 \) in the regression model.

3. **Calculate Parameters (\( \theta \))**:
   - Use the Normal Equation: \( \theta = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T y \) to compute the best-fit parameters.
   - \( X^T \) is the transpose of \( X \).
   - \( (X^T X)^{-1} \) is the inverse of the matrix \( X^T X \).
   - Multiply by \( X^T \) and then by \( y \) to get \( \theta \).

4. **Extract Parameters**: Extract the intercept and coefficients from the computed \( \theta \).

5. **Prediction**: Use the model to predict \( y \) values.

6. **Visualization**:
   - For simplicity, the code plots a 3D scatter plot if there are exactly 2 features.
   - It shows how well the model fits the data with a regression plane.

This approach helps in understanding how Linear Regression works with multiple features and how the model parameters are derived and used for predictions.
