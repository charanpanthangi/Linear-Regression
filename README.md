Here's a simple description you can use for your GitHub repository on the Linear Regression model:

---

### Linear Regression Model

This repository contains the implementation of a Linear Regression model for predictive analysis. It includes univariate and bivariate analysis, data splitting, model training, and testing. Additionally, the repository demonstrates how to save the trained model as a `.pkl` file and make predictions using new input data. 

Key features:
- Univariate and Bivariate Analysis
- Train-Test Split
- Model Training and Evaluation
- Saving and Loading Model using Pickle
- Input Prediction Example
