# Linear Regression Model

This repository contains a basic implementation of a Linear Regression model for predictive analysis. It includes step-by-step instructions on how to load a dataset, perform univariate and bivariate analysis, split the data, train and test the model, and save the trained model as a pickle (`.pkl`) file for future use. Additionally, it demonstrates how to load the saved model and make predictions using new input data.

### Key Features:
- **Univariate Analysis**: Visualize the distribution of individual numerical features.
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Explore relationships between independent and dependent variables.
- **Train-Test Split**: Split the data into training and testing sets for proper evaluation.
- **Model Training**: Train a Linear Regression model using the training data.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance with metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- **Saving the Model**: Save the trained model as a `.pkl` file using `pickle`.
- **Loading and Prediction**: Load the saved model and make predictions with new input data.

### Files:
- **linear_regression_model.pkl**: The trained Linear Regression model saved for future use.
- **train_test_split.py**: The script that includes data splitting, model training, and testing.
- **model_prediction.py**: The script for loading the model and predicting on new data.

### How to Use:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Add your dataset or modify the file paths to fit your environment.
3. Run the script to train the model, evaluate its performance, and save it.
4. Use the `model_prediction.py` script to load the model and test with new inputs.

### Example Usage:
1. **Training the Model**: 
    ```bash
    python train_test_split.py
    ```
2. **Making Predictions**:
    ```bash
    python model_prediction.py
    ```

### Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Pickle
